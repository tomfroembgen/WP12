\section{Bulk Properties of NaCl}
%
As part of this practical computational course, bulk properties of sodium chloride such as lattice parameters, atomization energies, band gaps and densities of states were computed. All calculations were performed using the \textsc{Crystal} program package.\autocite[]{crystal-1, crystal-2} An experimental crystal structure of sodium chloride was taken from the Crystallography Open Database\autocite[]{cod} (COD-ID: 9006369). This specific structure was chosen as experimental input because it was measured at $ \SI{50}{\kelvin} $ which was closest to the optimum temperature of $ \SI{0}{\kelvin} $ (temperature of the calculations).
%
\subsection{Structural relaxation}
%
Full structural relaxations on the LDA/VWN\autocite[]{lda-vwn}, PWGGA\autocite[]{pwgga}, M06L\autocite[]{m06l} and PBE0\autocite[]{pbe0} level of theory employing POB-DZVP-rev2 basis sets\autocite[]{pob-xzvp-rev2} were performed. Results are summarized in \autoref{tab:nacl-relax}. The LDA/VWN functional strongly underestimates the reference value of $ a_\mathrm{exp} = \SI{5.5937}{\angstrom} $ which can be deduced to the overbinding nature of the functional. Improvement comes with the meta-GGA functional M06L which nevertheless underestimates the lattice parameter by more than $ \SI{1}{\percent} $. Good accuracy is reached by PWGGA and PBE0. Noting the different levels used in this task -- namely LDA, GGA, meta-GGA and a hybrid functional which correspond to the levels one to four on Jacobs ladder of density functional theory -- it is unexpected that PWGGA and PBE0 representing rung two and four on Jacobs ladder, respectively yield results of the same quality whereas M06L belonging to rung three on Jacobs ladder performs worse. The good performance of PBE0 is expected as it is a high-quality method. GGA functionals as PWGGA are known to sometimes create metallic systems when computing insulators as NaCl. In this case, the unexpected good performance of PWGGA is probably due to fortuitous error cancellation of the functional and the small double-$ \zeta $ basis set. Such behavior was also observed in other computational lab courses. 
The hybrid functional PBE0 comes with a largely increased computation time which is about four times larger compared to the other functionals. In conclusion, it can be said that reasonable geometries do not require the use of hybrid functionals but can also be obtained from certain (meta-)GGA functionals. This is also well known for geometry optimization of molecules.\autocite[]{tpss,r2-scan-3c}

\subsection{Atomization energy}
%
The atomization energy of sodium chloride was computed employing PBE0 and POB-TZVP-rev2 basis sets\autocite[]{pob-xzvp-rev2}. To do so, the atomic basis sets were enlarged by adding \textit{s, p} and \textit{d} shells until the atomic energies $ E_\mathrm{Na}, E_\mathrm{Cl} $ were converged to a limit of $ \SI{1}{kcal \per \mole} $. Having reached the desired convergence, an atomization energy $ \Delta E_\mathrm{NaCl}^\mathrm{atom} $ of $\SI{623.3}{kJ \per \mole} $ was obtained according to
%
\begin{equation}
	\Delta E_\mathrm{NaCl}^\mathrm{atom} = E_\mathrm{NaCl} - E_\mathrm{Na} - E_\mathrm{Cl}
\end{equation}
%
as displayed in \autoref{tab:nacl-atom}. This value represents an electronic energy and cannot be directly compared to an experimental quantity which is usually the atomization enthalpy $ \Delta \mathrm{H^{0}_{atom}(NaCl)} $. Comparison is achieved according to the Born--Haber circle by adding the sublimation enthalpy of sodium $ \Delta \mathrm{H^{0}_{subl}(Na)} = \SI{107.3}{kJ \per \mole} $ and half of the dissociation enthalpy of chlorine $ \Delta \mathrm{H^{0}_{diss}(Cl_2)} = \SI{121.3}{kJ \per \mole}  $ to the negative enthalpy of formation of sodium chloride $ \Delta \mathrm{_f H^{0}_{solid}(NaCl)} = \SI{-411.1}{kJ \per \mole}$ (all values taken from the NIST chemistry webbook\autocite[]{nist}):
%
\begin{equation}
	\Delta \mathrm{H^{0}_{atom}(NaCl)} = - \Delta \mathrm{_f H^{0}_{solid}(NaCl)} + \frac{1}{2}\Delta \mathrm{H^{0}_{diss}(Cl_2)} + \Delta \mathrm{H^{0}_{subl}(Na)}
\end{equation}
%
This results in $ \Delta \mathrm{H^{0}_{atom}(NaCl)} = \SI{639.7}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}$. The atomization energy differs from that by $ \SI{-2.5}{\percent} $ which is due to the fact that atomization energy and enthalpy are per definition not identical. Thermal corrections need to be added to make the values comparable. According to basic physical chemistry, it is necessary to include the volume work ($ pV $) to come from energy to enthalpy. Additionally, all computed quantities have to be corrected to the temperature of the experimental reference to assure comparability. This can be achieved by employing well known formulae from statistical mechanics.

%
\subsection{Band gap}
%
Band gaps of sodium chloride were computed using PW1PW\autocite[]{pw1pw}/POB-TZVP\autocite[]{pob-xzvp}, PBE0/POB-TZVP, and PBE0/mTZVP\autocite[]{mtzvp}. The band gaps were first calculated with the standard amount of Fock exchange $ \alpha $ included in the respective functionals. Subsequently, self-consistent hybrid calculations were performed in order to determine the optimal amount of Fock exchange. Having obtained this information, band gaps were computed using the optimal amount of Fock exchange. Results are summarized in \autoref{tab:nacl-bandgap}. Note that the inverse of $ \alpha $ corresponds to the dielectric constant $ \varepsilon $.
%
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\captionabove{Calculated band gaps of sodium chloride ($ \si[]{\electronvolt} $), amount of Fock exchange $ \alpha $ and dielectric constant $ \varepsilon $.}

		Method         & Band gap & $ \alpha $ & $ \varepsilon $ \\

		PW1PW/POB-TZVP & 9.50     & 0.46       & 2.19            \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
%
During the past six decades, numerous experimental band gaps have been reported in the literature\autocite[]{nacl-bandgaps} mostly ranging from 8.4 to $ \SI{9.0}{\electronvolt}$. It can be seen that the quality of the calculated band gaps significantly increases upon using the optimized amount of Fock exchange. While all tested method with standard amount of Fock exchange underestimate the experimental band gaps, PBE0/mTZVP with an optimal amount of Fock exchange is well in the range of the reported reference values. However, there is an improvement for PBE0/POB-TZVP and PW1PW/POB-TZVP compared to the pure methods (without optimization of amount of Fock exchange). Hence, an mTZVP seems to be more suitable for this kind of calculation. A reason might be found in the missing diffuse functions in POB-TZVP in order to avoid linear dependencies in solid state calculations. Despite the increased accuracy, one has to keep the rather large computational effort of self-consistent hybrid calculations in mind.
%
\subsection{Projected density of states}
%
The projected density of states (PDOS) of sodium chloride was computed using PBE0/POB-TZVP with standard and optimal amount of Fock exchange (as given in \autoref{tab:nacl-bandgap}). It is displayed in \autoref{fig:pdos}.
%
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{Graphen/pdos.pgf}
	\vspace{-20pt}
	\caption{Projected density of states of NaCl on a PBE0/POB-TZVP level of theory with standard (left) and optimal Fock exchange fraction (right) obtained by a self-consistent hybrid calculation (see \autoref{tab:nacl-bandgap}). Energies are relative to the Fermi energy.}
	\label{fig:pdos}
\end{figure}
%
Generally, both PDOS plots look quite similar. The unoccupied crystal orbitals in the conduction band of the PDOS with optimal amount of Fock exchange are shifted to the right by $ \SI{1.9}{\electronvolt} $ as compared to the other one due to the larger band gap. In both cases, the valence band is dominated by chlorine and whereas sodium dominates the lower energy part of the conduction band. By that, in can be concluded that the highest occupied crystal orbital (HOCO) is mainly chlorine-centered and the lowest unoccupied crystal orbital (LUCO) is mainly sodium-centered. This observation is in line with the common understanding of the ionic sodium chloride crystal: Sodium donates its atoms to chlorine and is therefore present as $ \ce{Na^+} $, whereas chlorine forms $ \ce{Cl^-} $. Due to the electron deficient nature of the $ \ce{Na^+} $ it is straight forward that its orbitals are higher in energy than those of the electron rich $ \ce{Cl^-} $ anion.

\section{Calculating surfaces of Rutile}
%
The second part of this course dealt with the investigation of low-index rutile $ \ce{TiO2}$ surfaces including structural relaxations, slab models and surface energies as well as a Wulff construction. All calculations were performed using the \textsc{Crystal} program package. The Wulff construction was done with \textsc{Vesta}\autocite[]{vesta}. An experimental crystal structure of rutile\autocite[]{rutile-structure-cod} was taken from the Crystallography Open Database (COD-ID: 9004141). This specific structure was chosen as experimental input because it was measured at $ \SI{25}{\celsius} $ which was closest to the optimum temperature of $ \SI{0}{\kelvin} $ (temperature of the calculations).
%
\subsection{Structural relaxation}
%
Full structural relaxations on the PBE0, PWGGA, PBESOL\autocite[]{pbesol} and PW1PW level of theory employing POB-TZVP-rev2 (rev2) and the \textsc{Crystal} standard (std) basis sets were performed. Results are summarized in \autoref{tab:tio2-relax}.

	\captionabove{Full relaxations of rutile: Method, computation time (min), lattice parameter $ a,c $ ($\si[]{\angstrom} $) and their deviation from experiment $ \Delta a, \Delta c $ ($ \si[]{\percent} $) as well as the fractional $x$ coordinate of oxygen.}

		PWGGA/rev2  & 57.42     & 4.634 & 0.89        & 2.969 & 0.34       & 0.3048                          \\
		PBE0/std    & 184.25    & 4.565 & -0.62       & 2.981 & 0.74       & 0.3044                          \\
		PBESOL/std  & 13.97     & 4.577 & -0.35       & 2.970 & 0.39       & 0.3036                          \\
		PW1PW/std   & 219.18    & 4.571 & -0.47       & 2.982 & 0.77       & 0.3043                          \\
		PWGGA/std   & 23.77     & 4.617 & 0.51        & 2.993 & 1.16       & 0.3041                          \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
%
All tested methods give reasonable results for the lattice parameters $ a, c $ since they are - except for PWGGA/std at $ c $ - within $ \SI{1}{\percent} $ accuracy compared to the reference data of $ a_\mathrm{exp} = \SI{4.593}{\angstrom} $ and $ c_\mathrm{exp} = \SI{2.959}{\angstrom} $. Note that the reference data refer to $ T = \SI{298}{\kelvin} $ and therefore, are considered as high-temperature data. Hence, a lot of the computed lattice parameters (computation at $ T = \SI{0}{\kelvin} $) are too short (thermal expansion of matter).
There are some general trends observable: rev2 results are more accurate than std results which justifies the usage of the former basis sets instead of the \textsc{Crystal} default basis sets. The PWGGA functional is too repulsive and results in too large lattice parameters for both basis sets. The other GGA functional PBESOL yields better results and slightly underestimates the lattice parameters, except for $ c $ with the worse std basis sets. In contrast to that, the two investigated hybrid functionals do not perform systematically better than their GGA competitors. Instead, they perform even worse than PBESOL in most cases. Taking a look at the computed fractional $ x $ coordinates of the oxygen atoms, all investigated methods obtain almost identical results that are close to the experimental data of $x_\mathrm{frac}^\mathrm{exp} \mathrm{(O)} = 0.3051$. The differences are very small and negligible. The observation that hybrid functionals do not happen to be necessarily better than GGA functionals with regard to geometry optimizations was also found for NaCl and discussed before - especially, when noting the largely increased computation times. Note that this is not valid for heavily correlated systems (aromatic systems, open-shell transition metals).
%
\subsection{Surface energy}
%
Having received the information that PBESOL/rev2 is an accurate and cheap level of theory for geometry optimizations of rutile, low-index surfaces of rutile were investigated with this method. Surfaces were generated with the \textit{SLABCUT} option and specified by the parameters $ L, S $ which denote the starting layer and the number of atomic layers that form the surface, respectively. The surface slabs need to fulfill requirements in order to make the computation feasible. They
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item must be symmetric and conserve the symmetry of the underlying crystal structure (rutile) 
	\item must be stoichiometric w.r.t the sum formula of the compound ($ \ce{TiO2} $) 
	\item must not possess a dipole moment in $ z $ direction (the surfaces are formally formed in the $ xy $ plane)
\end{itemize}
%
Obeying these criteria, only certain values for $ L, S $ are possible. These are depicted in \autoref{tab:tio2-ls}.
%
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\captionabove{Allowed values for $ L, S $ in the definition of slab models of low-index rutile surfaces ($ j \in  \mathbb{N}$).}
	\label{tab:tio2-ls}
	\begin{tabular}{lcc}
		\toprule
		Surface & $ L $ & $ S $ \\
		\midrule
		(001)     & 1 & $j$  \\
		(100)     & 2 & $3j$    \\
		(101)     & 2 & $3j$    \\
		(110)     & 2 & $3j$     \\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
%
After having computed slab models consisting out of two to eight stoichiometric layers for the four given surfaces, the surface energy $ E_\mathrm{surf} $ can be obtained as
%
\begin{equation}
	E_\mathrm{surf} (n) = \frac{E_\mathrm{slab}(n) - n \cdot E_\mathrm{bulk}}{2A}
\end{equation}
%
where $ n $ denotes the number of stoichiometric layers, $ E_\mathrm{slab} $ is the slab energy, $ E_\mathrm{bulk} $ the bulk energy (3D system) and $ A $ is the area of the employed surface model. The course of the surface energy shows an odd/even oscillation and converges to the exact value with an increasing (and sufficiently large) number of stoichiometric layers. For reasons of convenience, the surface energies are not given in tables but in \autoref{fig:slab}. Note that for the (100) surface, $ S = 6j $ was used in the computation instead of $ S=3j $ as given in \autoref{tab:tio2-ls}. The computed surface energies are in good agreement with the literature.\autocite{rutile-surface-energy} They were supposed to be specifically compared to PW1PW/rev2 results (but for the largest surface model only). This is given in \autoref{tab:tio2-pw1pw-compare}. In case of the (001) and (101) surface, both methods agree on the surface energy. They do deviate in case of (100) and (110). Taking a look the above-mentioned literature, it can be seen that converging the surface energy requires more than eight stoichiometric layers. Therefore, the obtained results are considered acceptable.

		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
%
Furthermore, the relaxation of symmetry-nonequivalent atoms in $ z $ direction was to be investigated for the (110) surface, where relaxation denotes the difference between the relaxed (optimized) and the initial (non-relaxed) structure. The relaxations are displayed in \autoref{fig:dz}. Taking a look at the three distinct atoms in the topmost layer of the surface models first, it is observed that the sixfold coordinated Ti3 atoms move to larger distances whereas the fivefold coordinated Ti2 atoms show a negative $ \Delta z $. This means that Ti2 atoms are shifted towards the bulk and the Ti3 atoms are shifted oppositely which both is in accordance to the literature.\autocite[]{rutile-surface-energy} The observed shifts are a result of tendency of the atoms to correct the for lack of coordination. The oxygen atoms mostly show a slightly positive relaxation. Again, odd/even oscillations of the values are observed. 

Looking at the bulk-like atoms, the oxygen atoms do nearly not relax while Ti2 and Ti3 atoms show different behaviors for surfaces with odd and even number of layers: In odd layer surfaces one titanium atom per layer moves upwards due to an artificial mirror plane in the middle layer whereas the other ones do nearly not move. In even layer surfaces, it is observed that one titanium atom in each layer moves up, and the other one moves down but with a different magnitude. Again, observations are in accordance with literature.\autocite[]{rutile-surface-energy}

%
\subsection{Crystal shape}
%
Finally, the calculated surface energies are used to generate a graphical representation of the rutile crystal shape. According to Wulff's theorem, the length of a vector normal to a crystal face is proportional to its surface energy. Hence, knowing the surface energy of a sufficient number of surfaces enables a reliable representation of the crystal shape. The result is displayed in \autoref{fig:wulff} and compared to experimental data which are in nice agreement. Therefore, the presented approach to access surface energies and thereby the crystal shape are considered reasonable.

The crystal shape is also influenced by the molecular surrounding and imperfections / defects in the crystal structure. Furthermore, kinetic effects during the crystal growth process can have an influence on the crystal shape.
